# LoRa Basic Station Snap

This is a [companion snap](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/docker-companion-snap) for [LoRa Basicsâ„¢ Station for Docker](https://github.com/xoseperez/basicstation-docker).
This companion snap allows running and configuring a LoRa gateway on Ubuntu Core devices.

## Building and installation

We recommend you to build the snap on Ubuntu Server or Ubuntu Desktop.
It is not possible to build the snap on Ubuntu Core.
Make sure to build on a device with the same architecture as the device it will run on.
Alternatively you can do a [remote build](https://snapcraft.io/docs/remote-build).

Clone this repo, and then inside the cloned directory run the following command to build it.
If building is successful, a file named similar to `lora-basicstation_*_arm64.snap` will be created in the working directory.

```
snapcraft -v
```

You can copy this `.snap` file over to the Ubuntu Core device you want to install it on.
On the target device, install the snap using this command:

```
sudo snap install --dangerous ./lora-basicstation_*.snap
```

Snaps on Ubuntu Core normally run in a strictly confined sandbox. 
This snap needs access to the Docker Engine on the host, so we need to allow this special permission from inside the sandbox.
To do that, connect the required docker interfaces:

```
sudo snap connect lora-basicstation:docker docker:docker-daemon
sudo snap connect lora-basicstation:docker-executables docker:docker-executables
```

## Configuration

Configuration of the gateway is done similar to the Docker container, using the same config options as listed [here](https://github.com/xoseperez/basicstation-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#configure-the-gateway).
The only difference is that we use snap configs rather than environment variables.
It would be possible to create an environment variable file and pass that to Docker, but we prefer to use the standard snap configuration options.
This allows us to leverage the snap ecosystem to maintain and update our Ubuntu Core devices.

To translate from environment variables to snap options, we only need to change the name or key of the configuration option. 
The values remain the same.
For the variable name, change it to lower case and replace underscores with hyphens.
Then prefix it with `env.`.

Example:
`GATEWAY_EUI=DEADFFFEBEEF` becomes `env.gateway-eui=DEADFFFEBEEF`

After you have the configs in this format, you can set them one by one using the `snap set` command:

```
sudo snap set lora-basicstation env.tc-uri="wss://eu1.cloud.thethings.network:8887"
sudo snap set lora-basicstation env.tc-key=NNSXS...
```

Or with a single command:

```
sudo snap set lora-basicstation \
    env.gateway-eui=DEADFFFEBEEF \
    env.model=SX1301 \
    env.tc-key=NNSXS... \
    env.tc-uri=wss://eu1.cloud.thethings.network:8887 \
    env.device=/dev/spidev0.0 \
    env.interface=SPI \
    env.spi-speed=200000 \
    env.use-libgpiod=1 \
    env.gpio-chip=gpiochip4 \
    env.reset-gpio=22
```

The gateway software starts automatically after it is installed, and after a system restart.
You will however need to manually restart it after you changed the configurations.

The gateway software can be stopped using:

```
sudo snap stop lora-basicstation
```

And then to start it again:

```
sudo snap start lora-basicstation
```

To view the log output, run:

```
sudo snap logs -f lora-basicstation
```

# Debugging

## Verify that the Docker container is running

To make sure the docker container is running, execute the following command.
If it does not list any containers with the name `lora-basicstation`, the container is not running.

```
sudo docker ps
```

In edge cases during development there might be a `lora-basicstation` docker container running that is not controlled by the companion snap.
You can manually stop and remove it using:

```
sudo docker stop lora-basicstation
sudo docker rm -f lora-basicstation
```

## Reset concentrator

The most common issue with LoRa concentrators on a Raspberry Pi is misconfigured reset pins.
It is also not always clean which GPIO to use as reset.
The logs displayed by `snap logs lora-basicstation` will give an hint of which GPIO chip and line are used, and if it is successfully communicating with the concentrator.

To reset the gateway concentrator hardware, you can manually toggle the reset GPIO pin.
A convenience script is provided to assist with this.
The following example is for the Raspberry Pi 5.
Replace `RESET_GPIO="22"` with the correct GPIO line your concentrator is connected to.
If you are using an older Raspberry Pi, set `GPIO_CHIP` to `gpiochip0`.

```
sudo GPIO_CHIP="gpiochip4" RESET_GPIO="22" POWER_EN_GPIO=0 POWER_EN_LOGIC=0 ./reset.gpiod.sh
```

## Run with docker compose

As another layer of debugging we include a docker compose file.

Edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file with the correct environment variables for your setup.

Then start the container:

```
docker compose up
```

Check the logs to see if Basic Station is connecting to the LoRa Network Server,
the concentrator is started and calibrated successfully,
and packets are being received.

If the docker compose setup is working, you can translate the environment variables used by it into snap configs.

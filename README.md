# LoRa Basic Station Snap

This is a [companion snap](https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/docker-companion-snap) for [LoRa Basicsâ„¢ Station for Docker](https://github.com/xoseperez/basicstation-docker).
This companion snap allows running and configuring a LoRa gateway on Ubuntu Core devices.

## Usage

Build and install the snap:

```
snapcraft -v
sudo snap install --dangerous ./lora-basicstation_v2.8.3_arm64.snap
```

Connect the required docker interfaces:

```
sudo snap connect lora-basicstation:docker docker:docker-daemon
sudo snap connect lora-basicstation:docker-executables docker:docker-executables
```

Configuration of the gateway is done similar to the Docker container, using the same config options as listed [here](https://github.com/xoseperez/basicstation-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#configure-the-gateway).
The only difference is that we use snap configs rather than environment variables.
For the variable name (key), change it to lower case and replace underscores with hyphens.
Then prefix the key with `env.`.
The value remains exactly the same as before.

Example:
`GATEWAY_EUI=DEADFFFEBEEF` becomes `env.gateway-eui=DEADFFFEBEEF`

After you have the configs in this format, you can set them one by one using the `snap set` command:

```
sudo snap set lora-basicstation env.tc-uri="wss://eu1.cloud.thethings.network:8887"
sudo snap set lora-basicstation env.tc-key=NNSXS...
```

Or with a single command:

```
sudo snap set lora-basicstation env.gateway-eui=DEADFFFEBEEF env.model=SX1301 \
env.tc-key=NNSXS... env.tc-uri=wss://eu1.cloud.thethings.network:8887 \
env.device=/dev/spidev0.0 env.interface=SPI env.spi-speed=200000 \
env.use-libgpiod=1 env.gpio-chip=gpiochip4 env.reset-gpio=22
```

Start the service and check the logs:

```
sudo snap start lora-basicstation
sudo snap logs -f lora-basicstation
```

The gateway software can be stopped using:

```
sudo snap stop lora-basicstation
```

## Tested platforms

- Ubuntu Server 24.04 + Raspberry Pi 5 + [Pi Supply IoT Gateway Hat](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/iot-lora-gateway-hat-for-raspberry-pi) + [RAK833-SPI](https://www.rakwireless.com/en-us/products/lpwan-gateways-and-concentrators/rak833)

## Debugging

### Reset concentrator

To manually reset the gateway concentrator hardware, you can toggle the reset GPIO pin. A conveniance script is provided to assist with this. The following example is for the Raspberry Pi 5. Replace `RESET_GPIO="22"` with the correct GPIO your concentrator is connected to. If you are using an older Raspberry Pi, set `GPIO_CHIP` to `gpiochip0`.

```
sudo GPIO_CHIP="gpiochip4" RESET_GPIO="22" POWER_EN_GPIO=0 POWER_EN_LOGIC=0 ./reset.gpiod.sh
```

### Run with docker compose

Edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file with the correct environment variables for your setup.

Then start the container:

```
docker compose up
```

Check the logs to see if Basic Station is connecting to the LoRa Network Server,
the concentrator is started and calibrated successfully,
and packets are being received.
